### documentation
Make document in flutter -> use ///

`In flutter, when state changes, rebuild and repaint it's widgets and all of it's component widgets`

## Stateless Vs Stateful
Stateless -> Will re-rendered when input data(props as in js) changes
Stateful  -> Will re-rendered when input data or local data variable changes

`In Widget, you can define that class is with "c" icon and element is with "e". e can call it's key and class can initialize the instance property`

### SizedBox Vs Container
If you want to <b>only</b> control `width and height`, u should use `SizedBox`.

### VoidCallback Vs Function
As you donâ€™t want to return a value here, you will need to register a VoidCallback.
Where you want to return a value back to the parent or give a parameter, you will want to use Function(x).

```dart
class Test {
  Function(x) fCall;
  Test(this.fCall);
}

void main(){
  
  int fCall (int tt){
    return tt * 10;
  }
  
  var t1 = Test(fCall);
  print(t1.fCall(5));
}

```

### List Spread (...)
The element type 'Iterable<Answer>' can't be assigned to the list type 'Widget'.
So we use spread operator

### .toList()
'Iterable<Answer>' element type can be changed to list.

## final Vs const
final -> Initial state, we don't define it's value. After first time in run time, we define it's value and we can't change it later.
const -> It's value is constant and can never change.
